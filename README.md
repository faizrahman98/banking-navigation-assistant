Inspiration:

Our project was inspired by a compelling presentation from one of our sponsors, highlighting the complexities elderly people face with modern banking. 
We realized the immense potential for technology to bridge this gap and make digital banking more accessible. 
This inspiration led us to conceive an application that leverages generative AI, aiming to simplify financial transactions and information for the elderly, thereby fostering their independence and confidence in using banking services.

What it does:

Our application revolutionizes the way elderly users interact with banking services through the power of voice. By simply speaking to the app, users can inquire about their account details, make transactions, or get assistance with various banking needs. The app utilizes Google's speech-to-text recognition library to understand user prompts, which are then processed by the  LLM to generate responses. These responses are conveyed back to the user in a clear, human-like voice using the Eleven Lab API, making the experience seamless and user-friendly.

How we built it:

The construction of our application was a journey of integrating cutting-edge technologies. We employed Google's speech-to-text recognition library to accurately capture voice commands from our users. These voice inputs were then converted into prompts for the LLM model via OpenAI's API, allowing us to leverage the model's powerful generative capabilities. The responses from the LLM were transformed into natural, human-like speech using the Eleven Lab API, ensuring that our elderly users receive feedback that is easy to understand. The entire user interface was designed with simplicity in mind, utilizing Streamlit to create a friendly and accessible front end.

Challenges we ran into:

Throughout the development process, we encountered several challenges, including the coordination and collaboration within our diverse team, generating innovative solutions that address the specific needs of elderly users, and understanding the intricacies of various APIs. These obstacles required us to adapt, learn quickly, and foster a team environment where every member's contribution was valued and pivotal to our progress.
